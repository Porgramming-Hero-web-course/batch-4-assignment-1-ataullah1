# The Importance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful, type-safe programming language for developers. One of its key features is the Union Type and Intersection Type. These concepts make the developer's coding experience stronger, easier to read, and more reusable. In this blog, we will discuss the importance and usage of Union and Intersection Types.

## Union Type

A Union Type is a feature in TypeScript that allows a variable to hold multiple types. For example, a variable could be either a string or a number. Often, data from APIs may come in different formats, and Union Types help in handling that data effectively.

```
function resId(id: string | number): void {
if (typeof id === "string") {
console.log(`ID is a string: ${id.toUpperCase()}`);
} else {
console.log(`ID is a number: ${id}`);
}
}

resId("abc123"); // Output: ID is a string: ABC123
resId(101); // Output: ID is a number: 101
```

## Intersection Type

An Intersection Type is a feature that combines multiple types to create a new type. This is useful when a variable can have the properties of multiple types. Itâ€™s especially helpful when you need to use properties from multiple objects or types together.

```
interface User {
name: string;
email: string;
}

interface Admin {
isAdmin: boolean;
}

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const adminUser: AdminUser = {
name: "Alice",
email: "alice@example.com",
isAdmin: true,
};

console.log(adminUser);
```

In this example, the AdminUser type combines the properties of the User and Admin interfaces. This ensures that the adminUser object must contain the required properties from both interfaces.

### Summary

Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript help developers write more secure and flexible code.

- Union Types make dynamic data handling simpler.
- Intersection Types allow combining multiple types' properties in a single variable.
